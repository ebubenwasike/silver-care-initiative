        <!-- Our History -->
        <section class="section-card">
          <h2>Our History</h2>
          <p>SilverCare Initiative was founded in 2005 by Dr. Eleanor Richardson and a group of healthcare professionals who recognized the growing need for quality senior care that respected individual autonomy while providing necessary support.</p>
          
          <p>What began as a small 12-resident facility has grown into a thriving community serving over 150 seniors today. Our expansion has been guided by our founding principles while incorporating innovative approaches to senior living.</p>
          
          <p>In 2015, we introduced our acclaimed Memory Care Wing, specifically designed for residents with dementia and Alzheimer's. More recently, our technology integration program has enhanced communication between residents, families, and care teams.</p>
          
          <p>Throughout our growth, we've maintained our commitment to non-profit status, reinvesting all resources back into improving resident care and facility amenities. Our continued success is built on the trust of families and the dedication of our staff, who share our vision of exceptional senior care.</p>
